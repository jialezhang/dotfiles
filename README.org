| H-J-K-L            | resize the panel for the direction of left-up-down-right pane                                             |

| esc                | change into `copy-mode`(I have configuration to set short press `control key` as esc by using [Karabiner] |
| h-j-k-l(copy-mode) | move jump around left-up-down-right panel;                                                                |

for copy-mode: use normal vim-style short-key [v] to chose and [y] to copy current content when you exit copy-mode,you can use [prefix + p] to paste;but this the content is  not in the system buffer;
** TODO bashrc: configuration of previous bash 
** TODO create a setup.sh to auto import these configuration, eg:https://github.com/tankywoo/dotfiles
